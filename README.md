# 2021 Census Data Explorer

This repository contains code for an analysis that begun data pull for the [Kensington Market Community Land Trust](https://kmclt.ca/) and has evolved into a broader investigation of the most recent census data relating to housing affordability in Toronto.

The resulting report is not yet live online. An offline version is available upon request. In the future, an interactive document will be available online.

Run the R scripts in order. This will involve setting up an account to [access this API](https://censusmapper.ca/api#api_overview)

If you fork or otherwise borrow from this code, please credit the author.
